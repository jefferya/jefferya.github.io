# Sustainability in the Age of Generative AI

How do we choose what to sustain in our digital lives? What to archive? What to delete?

## Abstract <!-- omit from toc -->

During the Linking Cultural Data Sustainably Symposium, June 23-24 2022, Dr. Robert Sanderson introduced a framework for deciding whether to sustain a data product/project or not to sustain during the talk "Data is our Product: Thoughts on Sustainability of Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data". Fast forward to today, 2024, generative AI and LLMs (large language models) are generally available to the world via OpenAI ChatGTP, Microsoft Copilot, Google, and others. Does the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLM) change how we think about data sustainability and what should be sustained? What are the tradeoffs between sustaining versus archiving a data product in a generative AI & LLM world?

Firstly, we talk about the context for the discussion before moving into the framework described by Dr. Robert Sanderson. With this context, this discussion turns to how generative AI is interacting with data products/projects and what the impact of data product/project lifecycle.

## Context: What is a “Digital Product/Project”?

What do data products/projects like the Peer Prairie Provinces, The Orlando Project, and Wikipedia/Wikidata share? All share a foundation built on a curated data set, whether it be structured assertions like Wikidata, digitized newspapers and other primary sources like Peel or born-digital analytical textual content in narrative frm like Orlando or Wikipedia. In these examples, the software helps to discover and intrepret data but is largely ephemeral in that the software is not telling a story, for example, like text anaylsis software would tell. Data in this context is "Raw material from which information is extracted" (Lucky 1989) with people using the data to build information and obtain knowledge, and wisdom.

## Context: Life Cycle

As with life, every data product or project has a beginning and an ending. A project tends to be bound by a defined scope, maybe time or maybe features. Whereas a product could be comprised of one or many time/scope bound projects and as a product, not governed by a time/scope to the same extent as a project.

Both a data product and project have a lifecycle though the product may have a longer timeframe. The main components:

* Beginning / Startup
* Launch / Grow
  * Constraints (e.g., money, time, people, resources) which tigger the next stage
* Sustain / Maintain (?)
  * “Evade the archive” [1] (e.g., project renewal thus may cycle many times between the previous stage and this one)
* Archive / Preserve (?)
* Disappear

May skip 3 or 4 or both depending on project objectives

Beginning: A set of mission, vision, and values is defined to help guide the purpose of the product/project.

What the mission, vision, and values of the project/project efine what the lifecycle looks like. For example, a project might onlcy include a digital exhibit meant to represent a snapshot in time. whereas another might have a longer vision of sustained content creation and maintanance. The Endings Project [4] offers a set of principles for to enchance the longivity of a project/product. the principles hlep prepare data for evential archiving and graceful ending of a proejct/product plus principles offer help in sustaining. The Endings Principles helps to prepare for the worst but hope for the best if the mission, vision, values of the data includes sustainability.

Taking a step back in the lifecycle, what does the decision landscape look like at the inflection point between the sustain/maintain stage and the preparing for the end stages, archiving and disappearance? How does generative AI and LLMs change the decisions around what to sustain and what to end?

## AI / LLM tools interacting with CWRC sites

Digital collections and born digital research: public
Web Crawlers
Search engines
SEO
Knowledge bases / linked data
AI / LLMs
Examples
ChatGPT-User / GPT-Bot / CCBot
BingChat/Copilot: (leverages search bot, bingBot)
Google: (leverages search googlebot, Google-Extended)
Alexa: AmazonBot
others…

## AI / LLM tools interacting with DH sites

Block LLMs?
Technical protection?
No standard way
All / nothing
How to Block LLM Crawlers (Like ChatGPT's Bot) in 2024 (privacyjournal.net)
Legal Protection?
No strong legal precedent

## AI / LLM tools interacting with DH sites

How to sustain impact (e.g., Alootook Ipellie query)?
What should the content creator know?
What is the equivalent of SEO in generative AI?
Guess: same as practices as good search engine optimization?
Or more? LLM => black box
Or would a researcher be ok with fading AI model relevance?
E.g., when others have have done a “better” job of boosting the profile of a person/place/org/topic/etc.?
Research impact metrics?

## Does the Generative AI world change the decision framework?

Demand side: usage statistics:
Past: humans (e.g., Google Analytics definition)
Today: include LLMs?
User gains access to content via LMM
Thus, no indication on website itself of a user!
Audience:
LLM increases discovery of material?
Cost:
LLM accuracy/quality suffers during as a data product reaches the decline lifecycle stage

## Tradeoffs between sustain vs. archive in AI / LLM world?

Archived site = no updates?
LLM error correction if source static?
Marginalia equivalent in IA?
Decolonization impacts on LLMs?
Past: colonial / settler lens
Now: Increased usage of indigenous research methods
LLMs: continuously crawling

Tradeoffs between sustain/archive/delete in AI / LLM world?

Evolving knowledge
Static: stuck in the past
Orlando: gender terminology from 1990’s to 2020’s
